# WENet
This is the official code repository for "WENet: A Lightweight Dermoscopic Image Segmentation Network with Wide Edge Assistance Gen-erated by Morphological Erosion"

**1. Training and testing**

- Our code training, training set, and test set draw inspiration from open-source projects: https://github.com/JCruan519/EGE-UNet?tab=readme.
- You can generate wide edge labels for code training by using the 'Boundary' file yourself.

**2. Dataset**

- The dataset address also comes from https://github.com/JCruan519/EGE-UNet?tab=readme The address is: https://pan.baidu.com/s/1Y0YupaH21yDN5uldl7IcZA?pwd=dybm

**3. Obtain the outputs.**
- After trianing, you could obtain the outputs in './results/'
